Dynamic Host Creation in Ansible

1.	Create an AWS IAM user with EC2 full access and give programmatic access
2.	Login in to the EC2 Instance and configure awscli with below commands
Check aws –version, If it not installed in your instance follow below commands
a.	apt/yum install awscli
b.	apt/yum install python-boto
c.	check the .aws folder permission
d.	configure awscli with below commands
i.	aws configure
ii.	enter accesskey
iii.	enter security key
iv.	enter region details
v.	enter format as json
 Now check the aws –version.
3.	Gotot /etc/ansible folder and add below files into this folder
a.	ec2.py (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/blob/stable-2.8/contrib/inventory/ec2.py)
b.	ec2.ini (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/blob/stable-2.8/contrib/inventory/ec2.ini)
 After adding above files, We need to change the ec2.py file permissions
         chmod +x ec2.py
After changing above file permissions, then execute 
   ./ec2.py  --list
4.	Goto user(home) folder, Example either Ubuntu or something
Add below lines in .bashrc file
vim .bashrc
export ANSIBLE_HOSTS=/etc/ansible/ec2.py
export EC2_INI_PATH=/etc/ansible/ec2.ini
save that file
then execute below commands
$source .bashrc
$echo $ANSIBLE_HOSTS
5.	Goto your home folder and create a new folder
mkdir testoles
goto testroles folder , and run the below commands





vim site.yml

---  
-	name:  Test dynamic role execution
hosts: tag_Key_Value
gather_facts: true
become: true
roles:
   -  dynamicrole
Now save the above file and create a role with name dynamicrole with below commands
$ansible-galaxy init dynamicrole
Now, execute ansible commands to check whether it is connecting to dynamic ec2 instances
Ansible –m ping “tag_Key_Value”
