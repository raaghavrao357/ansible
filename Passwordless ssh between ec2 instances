Passwordless ssh between two AWS instances

https://markobigdata.com/2018/04/29/passwordless-ssh-between-two-aws-instances/

The recipe how I made paswordless shh work between two instances is the following:
•	create ec2 instances – they should be in the same subnet and have the same security group
•	Open ports between them – make sure instances can communicate to each other. Use the default security group which has one rule relevant for this case:
•	Type: All Traffic
•	Source: Custom – id of the security group
•	Log in to the instance you want to connect from to the other instance
•	Run:
	ssh-keygen -t rsa -N "" -f /home/username/.ssh/id_rsa
•	to generate a new rsa key.
•	Copy your private AWS key as ~/.ssh/my.key (or whatever name you want to use) (Pem file which is related to connecting instance)
•	Make sure you change the permission to 600
	chmod 600 .ssh/my.key  (Pem file)
•	Copy the public key to the instance you wish to connect to passwordless
	cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub | ssh -i ~/.ssh/my.key  username@10.0.0.X "cat >>/.ssh/authorized_keys"

Example: cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub | ssh -i ansibletest.pem ubuntu@172.31.0.42 "cat >> ~/.ssh/authorized_keys"

If you test the passwordless ssh to the other machine, it should work.
	ssh 10.0.0.X




Ansible basic command to test whether it is connecting to client instance

ansible test -i /etc/ansible/hosts -m ping

test is a group which is added in /etc/ansible/hosts file with private ip address

User run without password and root privileges add below lines in /etc/sudoers file
ali ALL = (root) ALL
ali ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: ALL



sudo vim /etc/ansible/hosts  Add your instances list in this file 

ansible testserver -i /etc/ansible/hosts -m ping

ansible all -i /etc/ansible/hosts -m ping

 

Note Client machine mandatorily pre-installed python , Before we execute ansible commands

To create a role below is the command
ansible-galaxy init rolename


Role execution site.yml and hosts files are with same roles folder

 

To execute a role
Ansible-playbook site.yml

Site.yml
--- 
-  name: “”first role book”
  become: true
  gather_facts: true
  hosts: all
   roles: 
    - raghavrole
